      In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate
      position between physics and biology.[6] It is sometimes called the
      central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both
      basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.[7] For
      example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the
      formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and
      how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the
      soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology),
      and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics). Chemistry is
      a study that has existed since ancient times.[8] Over this time frame, it
      has evolved, and now chemistry encompasses various areas of
      specialisation, or subdisciplines, that continue to increase in number and
      interrelate to create further interdisciplinary fields of study. The
      applications of various fields of chemistry are used frequently for
      economic purposes in the chemical industry.
