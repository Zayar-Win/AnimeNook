<h1>Computer programming</h1>

<p>
  Computer programming is the process of performing particular computations (or
  more generally, accomplishing specific computing results), usually by
  designing and building executable computer programs. Programming involves
  tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy
  and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a
  particular programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The
  source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are
  intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly
  executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find
  a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which
  can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a
  given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in
  several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
  specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

  Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging,
  source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of
  derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. However,
  while these might be considered part of the programming process, often the
  term software development is more likely used for this larger overall process
  – whereas the terms programming, implementation, and coding tend to be focused
  on the actual writing of code. Relatedly, software engineering combines
  engineering techniques and principles with software development. Also, those
  involved with software development may at times engage in reverse engineering,
  which is the practice of seeking to understand an existing program so as to
  re-implement its functionProgrammable devices have existed for centuries. As
  early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the
  Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player
  in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari
  invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton
  could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and
  cams.[6][7] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves
  by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in
  them. in some way.

  Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century,
  the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for
  deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic
  Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency
  analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.[8]

  The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada
  Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers,
  intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.[9] However,
  Charles Babbage had already written his first program for the Analytical
  Engine in 1837.[10]

  In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in
  machine-readable form.[11] Later a control panel (plug board) added to his
  1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by
  the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were
  programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic
  computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced
  in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in
  computer memory.[12]
